# Toggle and Hold Sneak/Sprint

## what is this

A 1.21.3+ port of the mod [Toggle Sneak & Sprint](https://modrinth.com/mod/toggle-sneak-sprint). Allows you to assign separate keys for "hold" sneaking/sprinting, so you can choose whatever method is most convinient.

(Also... that mod had a pretty jank way of setting your sprint. It would force you into it regardless of direction, which would get you banned on nearly every Minecraft server running an anticheat. ðŸ˜¨)

## great. how do i use it

Set the keys under "Movement":
